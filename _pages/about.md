ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Alex, I am a recent graduate research fellow with a decade of experience in tech. My current position is funded through the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), and I currently operate in the [Spatial Computing Department](https://spatial.umaine.edu/) at the [University of Maine](https://umaine.edu/). 

I am using my background in Robotics, Enginering, and User Centered Design to help shape the future of engineering education in the 21st century through academic research.

My research seeks to bridge the gap between engineering education and underserved communities by building virtual makerspaces and interdisciplinary engineering pedegogies. These are big tent ideas and I can't wait to see how we can collaborate together, please reach out!
